# Student Portal Firebase Integration

This document outlines the implementation of the student portal with proper Firebase integration.

## Overview

The student portal has been updated to fetch real data from Firebase instead of using hardcoded dummy data. The following components have been integrated:

### API Endpoints Created

1. **`/api/me`** - Get current user profile
2. **`/api/student/enrollments`** - Get student's enrolled courses and modules
3. **`/api/student/dashboard`** - Get student dashboard statistics
4. **`/api/enrollments`** - Manage student enrollments (admin/educator)
5. **`/api/dev/seed-data`** - Create sample data for development (admin)
6. **`/api/dev/sample-progress`** - Create sample progress data (admin/educator)

### Updated Pages

1. **Student Dashboard** (`/dashboard/student/page.jsx`)
   - Fetches real statistics from `/api/student/dashboard`
   - Shows enrolled modules, completed assessments, average grade, study streak
   - Displays recent activities based on actual progress data

2. **Student Modules** (`/dashboard/student/modules/page.jsx`)
   - Fetches enrolled modules from `/api/student/enrollments`
   - Shows real progress, completion status, and grades
   - Displays course information and module details

3. **Student Grades** (`/dashboard/student/grades/page.jsx`)
   - Fetches grades from `/api/student-progress`
   - Shows real assessment scores and module performance
   - Calculates statistics based on actual data

4. **Student Profile** (`/dashboard/student/profile/page.jsx`)
   - Fetches user data from `/api/me`
   - Displays student information from Firebase

## Authentication

The system uses NextAuth with JWT strategy. Authentication is handled automatically via cookies, so no manual token management is required in the frontend.

### Key Changes:
- Removed manual Authorization headers
- Using `credentials: 'include'` for API calls
- Authentication handled by `authenticateAPIRequest` utility

## Data Structure

### Firebase Collections Used:
- `users` - User profiles and authentication data
- `modules` - Course modules/subjects
- `programs` - Courses/programs (collections of modules)
- `enrollments` - Student course enrollments
- `student_progress` - Assessment scores and progress tracking
- `assessments` - Module assessments and tests

### Student Dashboard Data Flow:
1. Student logs in → NextAuth creates session
2. Dashboard fetches enrollments → Gets enrolled courses and modules
3. Dashboard fetches progress → Gets assessment scores and completion data
4. Data is processed and displayed in real-time

## Development Setup

### 1. Create Sample Data (Admin Required)

```bash
# Login as admin, then:
POST /api/dev/seed-data
```

This creates:
- Sample modules (JavaScript, React, Database Design)
- A sample course (Full Stack Web Development)
- Sample assessments for each module

### 2. Enroll Students (Admin/Educator Required)

```bash
POST /api/enrollments
{
  "studentId": "student-firebase-uid",
  "courseId": "course-firebase-id"
}
```

### 3. Create Sample Progress (Admin/Educator Required)

```bash
POST /api/dev/sample-progress
{
  "studentId": "student-firebase-uid",
  "courseId": "course-firebase-id"
}
```

This creates realistic progress data with random scores (70-100%) for all assessments.

## Error Handling

All pages include comprehensive error handling:
- Loading states while fetching data
- Error messages with retry functionality
- Fallback to empty states when no data is available
- Graceful degradation when API calls fail

## Key Features Implemented

### Real-time Data
- All student portal pages now fetch live data from Firebase
- No more hardcoded dummy data
- Automatic updates when data changes

### Proper Authentication
- Secure API endpoints with role-based access control
- Students can only access their own data
- Admins and educators have appropriate permissions

### Firebase Storage Integration
- Profile images are properly saved to Firebase Storage during registration
- Students can upload and change profile pictures from the profile page
- Images are displayed throughout the student portal (dashboard, profile)
- Automatic cleanup of old profile images when new ones are uploaded
- Image validation (file type and size limits)
- Secure image URLs with proper access control

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient data fetching with minimal API calls
- Proper loading states and error boundaries
- Optimized Firebase queries
- Optimized image storage and delivery

### User Experience
- Consistent loading states across all pages
- Clear error messages and retry options
- Responsive design maintained
- Smooth transitions and animations preserved
- Interactive profile image upload with hover effects
- Real-time image updates without page refresh

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Login as Admin**
   - Create sample data using `/api/dev/seed-data`
   - Create or approve student accounts

2. **Enroll Students**
   - Use `/api/enrollments` to enroll students in courses
   - Create sample progress data for testing

3. **Login as Student**
   - Navigate to student dashboard
   - Check modules page for enrolled courses
   - View grades page for assessment scores
   - Verify profile page shows correct information

## Next Steps

1. **Production Data**: Replace development seed data with real course content
2. **Advanced Features**: Add more detailed progress tracking and analytics
3. **Notifications**: Implement real-time notifications for new assessments
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure responsive design works on all devices
5. **Performance**: Add caching and pagination for large datasets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Unauthorized" errors**: Ensure user is logged in and has correct role
2. **Empty data**: Check if student is enrolled in courses and has progress data
3. **Loading forever**: Check Firebase connection and API endpoint availability
4. **Permission errors**: Verify user roles and API endpoint permissions

### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Firebase collections have data
3. Test API endpoints directly
4. Check NextAuth session data
5. Verify user roles and permissions
